# Star Squad's Star Map
An immersive experience to show the effect of global pollution on the night sky.

Users will spin a globe to select a location whose stars will be projected on a curved screen. Users will use an interface on the globe stand that allows them to choose the time/date, with a dial to scrub through a time range. The screen will be protected on three sides by black curtains to make the experience immersive. The projected night sky can be customized to see the impact of various types of pollution:
- Air pollution
- Light pollution
- Heat pollution
- Noise pollution
- Highlighted constellations
